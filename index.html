        The faculty with certified teaching professionals is there to guide the students through innovative techniques and improve their learning skills.</p><p>With LEAD’s school management system, the students undergo hybrid learning and fun based curriculum. Admissions of the candidates depend upon the decision of school management that is taken on the basis of seat availability and applicants’ marks in a written test and interview.
        The Sri Srija school is the best school in my opinion.</u> The Sri Srija school also have channels in YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook that are as follows:
